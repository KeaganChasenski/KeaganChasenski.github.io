# Intro
Hi, I’m a professional safari guide and software engineer with a passion for telling stories about the wild and building thoughtful tech. 
With a background in Computer and Electrical Engineering from UCT, I’ve always been drawn to systems — whether they're running on code or hidden in the heart of the african bush.

From the moment I stepped onto the grounds of boarding school, a mix of nerves and excitement fluttered within me, unknowingly marking the beginning of a deeply personal journey. It's a path that has led me through both inner landscapes and the breathtaking expanses of the natural world.

My heart truly found its compass in the hushed whispers of the African bush. The first time I encountered a leopard's track, etched in the earth like an ancient message, something primal stirred within me. Following those silent clues, feeling both utterly alone and profoundly connected, was like stepping into a realm of pure energy and an almost meditative peace. The moment I finally saw her – that magnificent creature of wild grace – sparked an incredible rush, yet it was underscored by a deep, unspoken trust between my tracker, the leopard, and myself.

That magnetic pull towards the wild found its anchor at Londolozi. Here, surrounded by untamed beauty and the raw rhythm of the wild, guiding others became more than just a job; it felt like a homecoming, a true embrace of the "wild self" that has always been a part of me.

Beyond the red dust and the golden dawns, my mind finds joy in exploration. I'm deeply passionate about research, always eager to delve into the unknown, and my camera lens allows me to capture those fleeting moments of beauty and authentic truth that often go unseen. The world of philosophical debate is another playground for me; I love to question, to explore different perspectives, and to seek a deeper understanding of things. This intellectual curiosity is reflected in the collection of over 700 quotes on my phone – little nuggets of wisdom I've gathered along the way.

In the everyday rhythm of life, I find a certain comfort in planning and organization – a way to bring clarity to the beautiful chaos around me. And in a small, perhaps quirky ritual, my left sock always goes on first.

My dreams paint a vibrant horizon: the fulfillment of nurturing my own game farm, the exciting challenge of launching a fintech business in Africa, witnessing the magical dance of the Northern Lights, and standing in awe of the majestic landscapes of Patagonia. Closer to my heart is the vivid image of riding a horse through the ancient, sweeping dunes of Namibia – a symbol of my deep connection to the land and my spirit of adventure.


# Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
